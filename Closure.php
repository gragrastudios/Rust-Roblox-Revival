            <p>We are going to discontinue RUST temporarily.</p>

            <p>Odd and I have felt as we are loosing motivation for the project and may even stop making revivals in its entirety. If we ever find motivation to bring this back, it may not be the same. If that means coming back in a few days, months, or even years! As of now, We are going to work on different projects. Such as Goodblos, Redblocks, and maybe more in the future.</p>
            
            <p>We thank you all for your participation in RUST and always supporting us (kinda).</p>
